# Flashcard Game - Learn and Test Knowledge

This project is a simple flashcard game designed to help users learn and test their knowledge on various topics. The game selects questions randomly from a pool of general knowledge, science, geography, and history. Players answer the questions and receive feedback on whether their answers are correct or incorrect.
